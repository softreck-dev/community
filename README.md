[community | People, Teams, Customers. we have launched a Softreck Community at community.softreck.com, location to gather and to discuss all things Softreck.](https://softreck.github.io/community/)

### Who is this community for?


It's for anyone and everyone who uses Softreck solutions.

Whether you are adding your first domain and don’t know what a name server is or you are managing 100s of domains via API or you are somewhere in between. 
In the Softreck Community you will be able to find tips, tricks, troubleshooting guidance and recommendations.

#### let's make the things ... better

We also think this will be a great way to get feedback from users on what’s working for them, what isn’t and ways that we can make Softreck better. 
There will even be opportunities to participate in early access programs for new and evolving features.

### How do I access it?

Anyone can visit [community.softreck.com](https://community.softreck.com/) and look around, 
soaking in all the information and expertise available, but in order to post questions or comments you must have a Softreck account. 
We wanted to keep this forum focused on using and improving Softreck and not about questions from people who visit sites that use Softreck services. 
When users visit the forum and try to sign-in for the first time they will go through the usual Softreck login process, but there will be an added step for email verification. Once that is done users are good to go.

### How to use the forum

We’ve started off with some broad categories like and created some tags to cover some of the more specific products and topics.
+ [Performance](https://performance.community.softreck.com), 
+ [Security](https://security.community.softreck.com)
+ [Product Feedback](https://feedback.community.softreck.com)
There is also a [Meta](https://meta.community.softreck.com) category where members can direct questions or suggestions about the Community. 

So, just put your topic in the area that you think is best, throw on a tag or two if necessary and we’ll all figure this out together. 
But don’t forget to [search](https://search.community.softreck.com) and see if someone’s already discussing it.

### let's discuss
We aren’t degrading our presence on social media or other popular discussion sites.
But we are hopeful that having a centralized location will make it even easier for people who want to get together and discuss their Softreck experiences to find the conversations they are looking for. 
So be sure to visit [community.softreck.com](https://community.softreck.com/) and say hello!
